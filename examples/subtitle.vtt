00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.070
Instructor: All right, so, let's kick things off

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.490
and talk about our course structure and outline.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.940
Now, first and foremost, this is a project-based course

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.340
and it's for people who want a practical,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.430
extremely hands-on and engaging approach

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.940
to learning Power BI Desktop for business intelligence.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.050
Now, along with the course,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.370
you're gonna have access to a number

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.620
of different types of resources.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.350
You'll get a downloadable PDF eBook,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.630
that's gonna contain all of the core slides,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.900
the assignments, the reference materials, and so on.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.840
You're also gonna have quizzes at the end of each section

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.550
and assignments throughout.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.980
These are to reinforce key concepts

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.770
and simulate the types of real world scenarios

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.920
that data professionals encounter on the job.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.960
We've got step-by-step solution videos

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.910
for each assignment as well.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.320
And last but not least,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.730
throughout the course you're gonna build

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.370
an entire professional quality

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.380
business intelligence dashboard,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.310
but we've also provided a complete bonus project at the end

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.860
to test your abilities and apply the skills

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.510
that you've developed throughout the course

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.790
to a brand new data set.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.950
Now, shifting gears into our outline here.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.680
We've got six sections that we're gonna dig into

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920
starting with an introduction to Power BI Desktop.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.110
We're gonna talk about installing the program,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.660
walk through the high level BI workflow,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.860
make some comparisons between Power BI and Excel, and so on.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.330
And then we're gonna start digging

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.090
into the business intelligence workflow,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.210
starting with connecting and shaping data.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.390
This is where we'll dig into ETL tools for extracting

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.710
and transforming and loading our raw data into Power BI.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610
Section three is all about taking those data sources

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090
and turning them into a relational data model.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.010
In this section, we'll cover all sorts

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.770
of data modeling foundations and fundamentals

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.290
like cardinality, normalization,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.890
primary and foreign keys, filter flow, and so on.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.410
And then once we have our model built

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.880
we're gonna talk about how to add

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.010
calculated columns and measures

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.610
using data analysis expressions or DAX.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.820
This is where we'll talk about the DAX formula syntax,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.160
the difference between columns and measures

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.050
and we'll review all sorts of common

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.230
formulas and functions like statistics functions,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.330
date and time, text functions,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.030
table functions, filter functions, and more.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.420
Section five is where we're gonna bring our data to life.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.700
This is where Power BI really shines

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.070
and it's where we'll practice applying all sorts

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.560
of visualization tools, like charts,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
graphs, matrix visuals, interactions,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.020
bookmarks, filter pans and more,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.950
to create our own custom dynamic dashboard.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.030
And then last but not least,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.980
we're gonna wrap it up with a quick discussion

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.070
about how to optimize Power BI performance

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.580
to make sure your reports run quickly and smoothly.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.200
So that's our plan of attack.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.813
Next up, let's talk about the course project.
